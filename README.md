# Portfolio


## Description

I've built this page to showcase my web development knowledge and projects.  
A traditional resume does not have interactivity and links to my work, so the goal of this page is to be able to provide potential employers a showcase of my capabilities.


## Installation

No installation required.  Links should all open in a new browser tab as you click on them.


## Usage

I'll be updating the links and features of this page as I learn more skills.
Potential employers will use this to get a showcase of my skills.


## Credits

University of Minnesota full stack bootcamp provided some of the materials used for the projects I've linked.  As I grow in projects, I'll be replacing these with completely original projects.
